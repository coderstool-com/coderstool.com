# CodersTool Developer Documentation

Welcome to the CodersTool documentation hub.

This area provides short, practical documentation for selected tools on  
[CodersTool.com](https://www.coderstool.com), grouped by category.  
Use it as a companion to the main site when you want a quick reference,  
examples, or a clearer explanation of what each tool does.

## Categories

- [Text & Unicode Tools](./categories/text-and-unicode/index.md)

## How this documentation is structured

Each category page includes:

- A short explanation of what the category focuses on.

Individual tool pages include:

- A link to the live tool.
