# UTF-16 Encoding & Decoding

**Live tool:** https://www.coderstool.com/utf16-encoding-decoding  

Convert between UTF-16 encoded text and readable strings so you can inspect, debug, or repair encoding issues.

## ✨ What it does

The UTF-16 Encoding & Decoding tool helps you:

- Decode UTF-16 byte sequences into readable text
- Encode text into UTF-16 for testing or integration work
- Spot byte-order markers (BOM) and endianness issues
- Understand how characters and emojis are represented in UTF-16

## 🔧 When to use it

- Debugging data coming from systems that use UTF-16 (e.g. some Windows APIs, older systems)
- Checking if a file or payload is encoded the way you expect
- Comparing UTF-8 and UTF-16 representations during migrations
- Teaching or learning about text encoding internals
