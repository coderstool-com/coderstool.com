**Live tool:** https://www.coderstool.com/aes-decryption  

Decrypt AES-encrypted data for debugging and testing using your own keys and parameters.

## ✨ What it does

The AES Decryption tool helps you:

- Decrypt AES-encrypted ciphertext using a provided key
- Experiment with different modes and padding options (as provided by the tool)
- Verify that your application is encrypting and decrypting data correctly
- Inspect sample payloads during debugging or integration work

## 🔧 When to use it

- Debugging integration between two services that exchange AES-encrypted data
- Verifying that your mobile app, backend, or third-party service uses the same keys and configuration
- Learning how AES encryption/decryption works in practice (with your own test data)

> ⚠️ Always use this tool with data and keys you control.  
> It is intended for development, testing, and educational purposes – not for breaking into systems.
