# SQL Syntax Checker

**Live tool:** https://www.coderstool.com/sql-syntax-checker  

Paste your SQL, run a quick syntax validation, and catch obvious issues before you hit the database.

## ✨ What it does

The SQL Syntax Checker helps you:

- Spot missing commas, parentheses, and keywords
- Validate basic SQL syntax before running queries
- Quickly sanity-check ad-hoc queries during development
- Reduce "run it, get an error, tweak, repeat" cycles

Typical use cases:

- Testing a query before you drop it into a migration or script
- Reviewing a colleague's SQL snippet
- Working in tools that don't have smart SQL validation built-in

> ⚠️ This is meant as a quick helper, not a full SQL engine.  
> It's ideal for catching common syntax mistakes early.
