# Coderstool – Micro Online Tools for Developers

Welcome! 👋  

This repo is the home base for **[Coderstool.com](https://www.coderstool.com)** – a growing collection of small, focused, browser-based tools for developers, makers, and technical teams.

No signup. No bloat. Just handy tools you can open in a tab, use, and close.

## 🚀 What is Coderstool?

Coderstool is a collection of **micro tools** that solve everyday dev problems:

- Converters (JSON ⇄ CSV, binary/hex, colour formats, etc.)
- Encoders & decoders
- Calculators and tiny utilities
- Cheatsheets and quick references
- “Fix this for me” helpers (clean this list, normalize this text, etc.)

The goal: **make boring tasks fast**, so you can get back to real work.

## 🧩 Docs in this repo

This repo also contains lightweight documentation for many of the tools on Coderstool, organized by category under `docs/`:

- `docs/categories/text-and-unicode/`
- `docs/categories/sql-and-databases/`
- `docs/categories/urls-and-seo/`
- `docs/categories/security-and-crypto/`
- `docs/categories/text-and-lists/`
- …and more as new tools are added.

Each tool gets a small markdown page with:

- what it does  
- when to use it  
- a link to the live tool  
- related tools

This is intended as a simple, low-maintenance knowledge base and topical authority hub, not a heavy docs platform.
